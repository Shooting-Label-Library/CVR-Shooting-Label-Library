**Camera Position and Height**

In cinematography, camera position refers to the spatial placement of the camera in relation to the scene and subjects being filmed. 

This crucial element of visual storytelling not only defines the viewer's perspective but also influences their emotional and psychological engagement with the narrative. 

Camera height, an integral aspect of camera position, determines the vertical axis of the camera, which can significantly affect the interpretation of the scene.
