**Ground Level**

**Insight**

Ground level shots in CVR create an immersive experience that can heighten the sense of presence but also increase discomfort if not handled carefully. According to the study, grounded perspectives generally resulted in lower embodiment scores compared to aerial perspectives but provided a unique immersive experience due to the close proximity to the virtual ground. This perspective can be particularly effective in creating a sense of realism and grounding the viewer within the environment, making them feel physically present within the virtual space.
