**Camera shot size:**

Determines how much of the scene is visible. 

Variations range from extreme long shots, capturing vast landscapes or settings, to close-ups that focus on a characterâ€™s facial expressions or small details. 

Each size serves a specific narrative purpose, affecting how viewers connect with the story and characters.

**Camera angle:**

The camera's angle relative to the subject adds another layer of meaning. 

High angles can make subjects appear vulnerable or insignificant, whereas low angles often convey power or dominance. 

Angles contribute significantly to the storytelling, subtly influencing the viewer's interpretation of the narrative.
