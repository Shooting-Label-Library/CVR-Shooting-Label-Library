CVR Practical Guideline: 

Low angle shots in CVR are effective for creating a sense of power and intensity. By positioning the camera below the subject, these shots can make the viewer feel smaller and less dominant, often increasing the perceived power or threat of the subject. Low angle shots are ideal for scenarios where you want to emphasize the importance, authority, or menace of a character or object, creating a dynamic and emotionally charged perspective.

**3. Case Studies/Examples**

Example 1: Dramatic Character Introductions

•	Scene: A low angle shot of a protagonist or antagonist making a grand entrance.

•	Emotion: Enhances the character’s importance and power, making them appear larger-than-life and more impactful.

Example 2: Monumental Structures

•	Scene: A low angle shot of a towering building or statue in a virtual tourism experience.

•	Emotion: Creates a sense of awe and respect, emphasizing the grandeur and significance of the structure.

Example 3: Intense Action Scenes

•	Scene: A low angle shot during a fight or chase scene in a VR game or film.

•	Emotion: Heightens the intensity and danger of the action, making the viewer feel more vulnerable and engaged.

**Challenges:**

•	Viewer Comfort: Low angle shots can sometimes make viewers feel uneasy or overwhelmed if overused.

•	Control Balance: Ensuring the viewer does not feel too disempowered requires careful shot composition and context.

**Summary**

Low angle shots in CVR provide a powerful tool for creating a sense of power and intensity. By leveraging the specific emotional impacts—slightly negative pleasure, high arousal, and low dominance—creators can effectively engage viewers in scenarios that emphasize power dynamics and intensity. These shots are invaluable in dramatic character introductions, showcasing monumental structures, and enhancing the impact of intense action scenes.
