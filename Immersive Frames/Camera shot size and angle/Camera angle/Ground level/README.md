CVR Practical Guideline: 

Ground level shots in CVR are particularly effective for creating immersive and often disorienting experiences. This perspective can make the viewer feel small and vulnerable, enhancing the intensity and emotional impact of the scene. Ground level shots are ideal for scenarios where a sense of immersion and vulnerability is needed, such as in horror or thriller settings, or to emphasize the scale and power of surrounding elements.
