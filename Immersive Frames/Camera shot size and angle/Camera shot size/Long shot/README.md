CVR Practical Guideline: The performance of long shots in CVR is generally easy to adapt, particularly effective due to their capacity to comfortably encompass wide areas of the virtual environment, making them ideal for establishing context and setting. This shot type not only facilitates easy adaptation for viewers but also enhances emotional engagement by providing a broad overview that can generate higher levels of pleasure, arousal, and dominance. The distance maintained from human models or central subjects within these shots helps in reducing discomfort and allows for a comprehensive view of the scene, making long shots highly recommended for use in various CVR scenarios where an expansive perspective is needed.
