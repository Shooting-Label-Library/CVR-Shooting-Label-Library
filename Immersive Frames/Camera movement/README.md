**Camera movement**

Camera movement encompasses the dynamic changes in the position and orientation of the camera as it captures a scene. 

These movements, which include pans, tilts, dollies, and tracking shots, play a pivotal role in shaping the narrative flow and directing viewer attention. 

By manipulating the motion of the camera, filmmakers can enhance the emotional impact of a scene, create a sense of spatial awareness, and dynamically engage the audience, making the camera an active participant in the storytelling process.
