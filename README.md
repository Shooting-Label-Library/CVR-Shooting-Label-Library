# Welcome to Immersive Frames: A CVR Shots Library (if-CVR) üé•üåê

if-CVR is designed to support researchers and practitioners in the field of Cinematic Virtual Reality (CVR) by providing a useful resource of empirically tested VR scenes. 

This library aims to simplify the research process by offering readily accessible VR content that reduces the modeling effort typically required. 

**Our Goals:**

1. Enhance Accessibility: 
We strive to make CVR experimental materials available to a broad audience within the CVR community.

2. Contribute to Community: 
Beyond sharing resources, we aim to provide practical insights for researchers and practitioners.

3. Support Research: 
Our library enables you to focus more on exploring new ideas and less on the labor-intensive process of creating scenes from scratch.
