**Library Organization**
The if-CVR is organized into three main categories:

**Camera Shot Size and Angle**
This category includes Long shot, Full shot, Mid shot, Close shot, Close-up, as well as High angle, Low angle, Eye-level, Ground-level, and Bird's eye view shots.

**Camera Position and Height**
This includes Aerial perspectives in High angle, Low angle, and Eye-level; Grounded perspectives in High angle, Low angle, and Eye-level; plus additional variations combining Aerial and Grounding perspectives at different angles.

**Camera Movement**
This section stores files for three types of asynchronous camera movements: Pan, Tilt, and Dolly.

Each category contains a detailed README that provides practical insights for CVR production.
